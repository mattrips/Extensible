# Extensible Swift

An architecture leveraging Swift's protocol-oriented approach to write code that is truly portable across frameworks, libraries, SDKs, and platforms.

### The Challenge
To express code in multiple contexts without rewriting the code, while taking full advantage of the features available in each context.  This challenge requires a system that is flexible in adding to and changing content, on the one hand, and in adding to and changing the modes of expressing content, on the other hand.   

Traditionally, systems have not been able to deliver both capabilities simultaneously.  Usually, a system that can conveniently add a feature is constrained in its ability to add ways of expressing features.  And, systems that can readily add new expressions typically are not able to handle new features easily.

This challenge is sometimes referred to as the [Expression Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem).
